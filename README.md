stroykapee open wordpress base structure to make functions in woocommerce


Code your own functions and worry less about html design of your shop as wordpress made this UI design for shop example..

NOTE:
This open source template from wordpress will not display by simply installing it.. You will need a programmer to enable functions..



For ordinary people who are not php or wordpress developers themselves, you can buy templates with this wordpress design outside github and the authour or buyer would have options for you to easily customize it without need for coding knowledge.


Popular examples are the kapee theme and stroyka wordpress theme sold outside as templates non-developers can edit without any knowledge of php and wordpress development.    

For PHP and wordpress development, clone the repository and get your functions going. Tag me on social media with #атлантстрой or #stroyka and let me see the amazing functions you have called from the UI in wordpress or selling to customers.

# Please This Does NOT work with woocommerce by itself.. you would have to call the woocommerce functions and all additional functions yourself before it can work on wordpress
